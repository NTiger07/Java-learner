The Scanner class is used for collecting user input of various types.

println vs print: print does not add a new line character, println does.
printf: formats a string just like the String.format method.


Arrays have a definite size which is specified at initialization,
Lists have a dynamic size.

for Strings string.length() is a method,
while for Arrays array.length is a property

Binary search only works on sorted arrays,
so make sure to sort the array first before performing the Binary search.
If an item does not exist in an array, array.binarySearch() will return a negative value.

The main difference between the for loop and while loop is that:
In a for loop the for statement contains an initialization, a condition and an expression to update the initial value ,
a while loop only contains a condition, it's initialization is done outside the while loop and it's expression to update is in the body of th loop.

HashMaps show up in random order.


OOP
Abstraction is abstracting the complex functionality of a class into a simple form.
Inheritance: a child class can inherit properties and methods from a parent simply using the 'extends' when defining the class and 'super' in the constructor method.
